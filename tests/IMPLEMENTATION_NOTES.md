# Jarvis-MK42 Test Implementation Notes

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the tool tests in Jarvis-MK42 and notes any remaining issues that might need future attention.

## Completed Fixes

1. **Fixed Invocation Pattern**
   - Updated all tests to use the `.ainvoke()` method with a dictionary of parameters
   - Standardized parameter passing across all tool tests

2. **JSON Response Handling**
   - Added proper parsing for JSON responses in tools like `sequential_thinking_tool`
   - Ensured correct extraction of content from nested response structures

3. **Chainlit Context Mocking**
   - Added proper mocking for Chainlit context in multimodal tools
   - Ensured tests can run without an active Chainlit session

4. **Specific Test Fixes**
   - **test_multimodal_tools.py**: Updated to use the `.ainvoke()` method and handle Chainlit context
   - **test_file_tools_new.py**: Made assertions more flexible for Python file content
   - **test_agents_tools.py**: Fixed mocking of the coding_tool output format
   - **test_plotting.py**: Fixed variable names and expectations
   - **test_reasoning_tools.py**: Updated to handle proper JSON parsing from response content

5. **Documentation**
   - Updated README.md with clear instructions on tool invocation patterns
   - Added examples of correct testing approaches for different tool types

## Remaining Issues

1. **Tkinter/Matplotlib Issue**
   - âœ… FIXED: Updated `test_plotting.py` to use a non-interactive backend (`Agg`) for Matplotlib
   - This eliminates the dependency on Tkinter for running tests

2. **Pydantic Deprecation Warnings**
   - Warning about class-based `config` being deprecated in Pydantic V2.0
   - Should be addressed when updating the codebase to fully support Pydantic V2

3. **AnyIO Deprecation Warning**
   - Warning about `cancellable=` being deprecated in AnyIO 4.1.0
   - Should use `abandon_on_cancel=` instead in research tools

4. **Asyncio Fixture Scope Warning**
   - Warning about unset `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope`
   - Should be addressed by explicitly setting the fixture loop scope in conftest.py

## Future Recommendations

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Consider adding more edge case tests for complex tools
   - Test error handling more thoroughly

2. **Test Configuration**
   - Create a dedicated test configuration that doesn't depend on environment variables
   - Use pytest fixtures more extensively for setup and teardown

3. **CI Integration**
   - Set up automated test runs in CI to catch issues early
   - Include test coverage reporting

4. **Test Data Management**
   - Create dedicated test data files separate from test code
   - Implement better cleanup for temporary test files
